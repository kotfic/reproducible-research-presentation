* Reproducible Research
This is a repository for managing files, folders and other errata for a presentation on reproducible research at the 2013 Open Access Week symposium put on by the University at Albany Library. 

This presentation is implemented using reveal.js  and the very nifty org-reveal.el which alows exporting to reveal-style html from emacs using org-mode.
