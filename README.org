* Reproducible Research
This is a repository for managing files, folders and other errata for a presentation on reproducible research at the 2013 Open Access Week symposium put on by the University at Albany Library. 

Hopefully it will be an opportunity to practice what I preach by generating the slides for the presentation as a LaTeX beamer presentation with slides,  figures etc being generated by embeded code.  

We'll see.
