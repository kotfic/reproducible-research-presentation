<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Graduated last spring with an MSIS from here at UAlbany
</p>

<p>
Focused primarily on scholarly communication and open access
</p>

<p>
Last 10 years -amature/professional software developer
</p>

<p>
both in private sector doing web application development
</p>

<p>
and in academia as a research assistant.

<h3>That's a long title</h3>
<p>
Are you really going to talk about all that in 30 minutes?
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the answer of course is no.
</p>

<p>
This talk is going to focus on reproducible research
</p>

<p>
cast it in the light of some problems that software engineers have been facing for a number of years
</p>

<p>
and then really what I'm really hoping is that I'll get a chance to show you some really cool tools that have emerged in the last 5 to 10 years
</p>

<p>
and then talk about how these tools related to open access and open data.

<h2>An Example from personal experience</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So - I began working as a research assistant here at Albany at the beginning of this summer
</p>

<p>
The work I'm learning to do involves writing computer programs to to pull structured information out of unstructured medical discharge summaries.  
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of interesting and practical applications for work like this
</p>

<p>
tracking patient outcomes for instance
</p>

<p>
identifying systematic issues at hospitals or with health care processes - lots of stuff.
</p>

<p>
This is done primarily with natural language process tools (ie.  computer programs and processes) 
</p>

<p>
As an initial exercize I set out to reproduce a well performing system in a particular challenge that tried to identify whether patients had obesity based on the free-form text in their medical record.

<h2>The idea was&#x2026;</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-1" >

<h3>reproduce the system based on the description in the paper,</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-3-2" >

<h3>try to identify any systematic errors the system made</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-3-3" >

<h3>correct those errors</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-3-4" >

<h3>publish in a prestigious journal</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-3-5" >

<h3>get a tenure-track position at a respected university</h3>

<h3>live happily ever afer</h3>

<h2>So It turns out&#x2026;</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So it turns out this wasn't a very good plan - 
</p>

<p>
I spent about a month trying to reproduce the system from the paper - too many variables, too much complexity
</p>

<p>
Finally in desperation I emailed the original authors, while they were extreamly helpful - the original system couldn't be found. 
</p>

<p>
They had moved to a different institution
</p>

<p>
It was simply no longer accessable.
</p>

<p>
So now there is this system documentation- this paper- that describes a well performing system- 
</p>

<p>
but the system, the solution in its most tangible form is gone.

<h3><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Notes about early goals of reproducability</h3>
<p>
Printing press is the technology that enables the goals of reproducability (as Shirky poitns out - some 150 years later)
Internet and modern computing is the technology that creates the current threat to the <code>Credability</code> of the research process
But Technology can also help to solve the problem it is creating.

“The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete &#x2026; set of
instructions [and data] which generated the figures.”

<h2>The Open Science Pipeline</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Really reproducible research spans all the steps between a data source and a publiction. 
</p>

<p>
All the steps involved in obtaining,  scrubing, modeling and interpreting the data. 
</p>

<p>
This doesn't HAVE to be in the context of an open data and open access 
</p>

<p>
BUT - in this context open reproducible research brings end-to-end transparency to the entire process.
</p>

<p>
Luckily Reproducibility is (arguably) the number one  concern of software developers.
</p>

<p>
And they've been building tools to support reproducibility for the last 30 or 40 years.

<h2>Code and Documentation</h2>

<p>
For software developers documentation tends to take a back seat to code

<p>
For researchers code (and data processesing) tends to take a back seat to documentation

and by documentation i mean a publishible paper.
