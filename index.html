<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Graduated last spring with an MSIS from here at UAlbany
</p>

<p>
Focused primarily on scholarly communication and open access
</p>

<p>
Professional background is as a software developer
</p>

<p>
Primarily working with open source tools and in the open source community
</p>
</aside>

<section id="sec-2-2" >

<h3>That's a long title</h3>
<p>
Are you really going to talk about all that in 30 minutes?
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the answer of course is no.
</p>

<p>
This talk is going to focus on reproducible research
</p>

<p>
In particular I'm going to be talking about how tools that software developers have created 
</p>

<p>
can help to solve the so-called reporducibility crisis
</p>

<h3>Caveat</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Release early, release often"<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<sup id="fn.1" style="font-size:18px;"> [1] Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997) </sup>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So there is a relatively well established philosophy in software development "Release early release often"
</p>

<p>
In software this means,  get your program out there as soon as possible and let people start giving you feedback
</p>

<p>
This presentation emerges from a number of threads that have been stewing for the last couple of years
</p>

<p>
The ideas here are still a little rough,  in true Open Source fashion,  I hope you'll help me refine them.

<h2>An Example from personal experience</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So - I began working as a research assistant here at Albany at the beginning of this summer
</p>

<p>
The work I'm learning to do involves writing computer programs to to pull structured information out of unstructured medical discharge summaries.  
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of interesting and practical applications for work like this
</p>

<p>
tracking patient outcomes for instance
</p>

<p>
identifying systematic issues at hospitals or with health care processes - lots of stuff.
</p>

<p>
This is done primarily with natural language process tools (ie.  computer programs and processes) 
</p>

<p>
As an initial exercize I set out to reproduce a well performing system in a particular challenge that tried to identify whether patients had obesity based on the free-form text in their medical record.

<h2>The idea was&#x2026;</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-1" >

<h3>reproduce the system based on the description in the paper,</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-4-2" >

<h3>try to identify systematic errors</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-3" >

<h3>correct those errors</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-4" >

<h3>publish in a prestigious journal</h3>

<section id="sec-4-5" >

<h3>get a tenure-track position at a respected university</h3>

<h2>So It turns out&#x2026;</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So it turns out,  this wasn't really a great plan -
</p>

<p>
The system is unrecoverable, 
</p>

<p>
and sadly (for me at least) un-reproducible.
</p>

<p>
This is the experience that got me interested in the topic 
</p>

<p>
so lets talk a little more about some of the background

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Fundimentally rooted in scientific skepticism. 
</p>

<p>
Findings may be interesting - but if they can't be reproduced by other researchers in normalalized settings 
</p>

<p>
Then those findings are suspect - they don't meet the "bar" of reproducibility
</p>

<p>
Which brings us to our first point:

<p>
our modern day style of scholarly communication really begins with the introduction of the printing press into the scholarly process
</p>

<p>
The wide distribution of ideas allowed for scholars across Europe to test and refine the ideas of their peers.

Today we face a new distribution mechanism:

<h2>Technology makes Reproducibility hard</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Computational science has enabled great advances in human knowledge - 
</p>

<p>
Current mechanisms for distributing scientific findings are insufficient
</p>

<p>
Analysis and interpretation may still fit on 9 pages (not including references)
</p>

<p>
But the data, the systems, the code - these linger and die on servers in campus closets.

<h2>The Open Science Pipeline</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Really, reproducible research is concerned with ALL the steps between a data source and a publiction. 
</p>

<p>
This means obtaining, scrubing, modeling, interpreting and presenting data. 
</p>

<p>
This doesn't HAVE to be in the context of an open data and open access 
</p>

<p>
BUT - in this context open reproducible research brings end-to-end transparency to the entire process.

“The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete &#x2026; set of
instructions [and data] which generated the figures.”

David Donoho is one of the reseachers over at Stanford who has been actively involved with the reproducibility movement for decades

<p>
Of course there are many many more examples

<p>
but what I'd like to humbly suggest here in this presentation,  
</p>

<p>
is that there are STRONG examples in the open source software development community

for how resolve the <b>technical</b> and <b>socio-cultural</b> aspects of the computational reproducibility problem.

<h2>Open Source Software Developers</h2>

<p>
Reproducibility is (arguably) the number one concern of open source software developers.
</p>

<p>
As an software developer,  if the code i write and run on my system 
</p>

<p>
doesn't run on your system
</p>

<p>
my code is broken.

<h2>Open Source Software Developers and Researchers</h2>
<p>
(have a lot in common)

<h3>Highly specialized</h3>

<h3>Experts in their area</h3>

<h3>Collaborate frequently</h3>
<p>
Usually working on teams that are <br  />
geographically disparate  <br  />
culturally diverse
</p>

<h3>Code and Documentation</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
For software developers documentation tends to take a back seat to code 
</p>

<p>
For researchers code (and data processesing) tends to take a back seat to documentation
</p>

<p>
and by documentation i mean a publishible paper.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Software developers have been faced with the reproducibility problem for decades
</p>

<p>
because the success of an open software development project is BASED on its ability to be reproduced across many systems
</p>

<p>
open source software DEVELOPERS have produced tools that are optimized to ease this distribution.
</p>

<p>
Because of the similarities between open source software developers and researchers many of these tools can be recast in light of the research process.

<p>
Keeping track of changes in a single document is hard
</p>

<p>
Keeping track of changes from a group of authors and reviewers in a single document is even harder
</p>

<p>
Magnify that difficulty by the thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of documents in an software development project
</p>

<p>
and you might as well pack up and go home
</p>
</aside>

</section>
<section id="sec-19-2" >

<h3><b>Who</b> did <b>what</b>, <b>when</b> and <b>why</b>?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The only way to manage this effectively is build a system that tracks WHO did WHAT WHEN, and most importaintly WHY.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example
</p>
</aside>
<p>
An Example of a <a href="https://github.com/kotfic/reproducible-research-presentation/commit/04ff60559adcf31f627f909c2cc4e00f1c564509">"Commit"</a>
</p>

<section id="sec-19-3" >

<h3>Diffs and Patches</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Tracking this information in such excrutiating detail provides interesting possibilities
</p>

<p>
For one it allows you to pass the changes that you make to a document easily to someone else
</p>

<p>
Source Control Management systems will (mostly)  seamlessly integrate your changes into other people's copy of your document.
</p>

<p>
additionally this kind of specificity allows for profound archiving possibilities and provides a bedrock for developing altmetrics
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-19-4" >

<h3>Repositories</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Code that is being tracked and shared with a source control management system is usually stored in a "repository"
</p>

<p>
Members of a team have read and write access to this repository and the repository is usually used to coordinate changes made by different team members.
</p>

<p>
How exactly this is done is a whole other presentation (at least)

<h2>Git and Github</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Many of these solutions have been around for a long time,  
</p>

<p>
its only beein the last 5 to 10 years that web technologies have enabled some of the most interesting advances in source control management.
</p>

<p>
In particular with Git,  which a source control management system, 
</p>

<p>
and with Github,  which is a community built around and ontop of git.

<h3>Linux</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Linus created the Linux kernl and is some times refered to as the "Benevolent Dictator for Life"
</p>

<p>
Git is used to manage many open source projects, including the Linux kernel which is (I believe)  around 25 million lines of code.
</p>

<h3>Git is free</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
All thats really important to understand is that git is a robust, distributed source control management system
</p>

<p>
Its open source technology, anyone can download and run git.
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-21-5" >

<h3>Git is distributed</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Git is particularly revolutionary because it does not require a single centralized repository, 
</p>

<p>
each "clone" of a git repository contains the whole history of the repository 
</p>

<p>
each clone integrates patches from other developers (or researchers)
</p>

<p>
and push changes out to other developers (or researchers)

Github is an online community that is built around and ontop of git. 
</p>

<p>
Over 4 million people use github to host and share their code with eachother.

<p>
Githubs model is innovative because they offer free git repository hosting as long as the code you share is public

<p>
Wait.. public as in anyone can edit it?

<p>
No, only people who are given permission have write access to the repository,

<h3>Open Access</h3>

<p>
Github is a world where "Open Access is the Default"
</p>

<p>
and I think you can make a pretty defensible argument that Github is the single largest open access publication platform that currently exists.

<p>
In particular it provides a particularly fascinating feature that correlates nicely with research workflows.
