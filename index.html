<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Graduated last spring with an MSIS from here at UAlbany
</p>

<p>
Focused primarily on scholarly communication and open access
</p>

<p>
Last 10 years -amature/professional software developer
</p>

<p>
both in private sector doing web application development
</p>

<p>
and in academia as a research assistant.
</p>
</aside>

<section id="sec-1-2" >

<h3>That's a long title</h3>
<p>
Are you really going to talk about all that in 30 minutes?
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the answer of course is no.
</p>

<p>
This talk is going to focus on reproducible research
</p>

<p>
cast it in the light of some problems that software engineers have been facing for a number of years
</p>

<p>
and then really what I'm really hoping is that I'll get a chance to show you some really cool tools that have emerged in the last 5 to 10 years
</p>

<p>
and then talk about how these tools related to open access and open data.

<h3>Caveat</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Release early release often"<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<sup> [1] Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997) </sup>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So there is a relatively well established philosophy in software development "Release early release often"
</p>

<p>
In software this means,  get your program out there as soon as possible and let people start giving you feedback
</p>

<p>
This presentation emerges from a number of threads that have been stewing for the last couple of years
</p>

<p>
The ideas here are still a little rough,  in true Open Source fashion,  I hope you'll help me refine them.

<h2>An Example from personal experience</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So - I began working as a research assistant here at Albany at the beginning of this summer
</p>

<p>
The work I'm learning to do involves writing computer programs to to pull structured information out of unstructured medical discharge summaries.  
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of interesting and practical applications for work like this
</p>

<p>
tracking patient outcomes for instance
</p>

<p>
identifying systematic issues at hospitals or with health care processes - lots of stuff.
</p>

<p>
This is done primarily with natural language process tools (ie.  computer programs and processes) 
</p>

<p>
As an initial exercize I set out to reproduce a well performing system in a particular challenge that tried to identify whether patients had obesity based on the free-form text in their medical record.
</p>
</aside>

<h2>The idea was&#x2026;</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-1" >

<h3>reproduce the system based on the description in the paper,</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-3-2" >

<h3>try to identify systematic errors</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-3" >

<h3>correct those errors</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-4" >

<h3>publish in a prestigious journal</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-5" >

<h3>get a tenure-track position at a respected university</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-6" >

<h3>live happily ever afer</h3>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="sec-4" >

<h2>So It turns out&#x2026;</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
You can probably guess from the title of the talk,  this did not go as planned.
</p>

<p>
The system itself is gone - emailed the authors,  they were extreamly helpful
</p>

<p>
but it was stored on a server they no longer have access too.
</p>

<p>
the system, the solution in its most tangible form, is gone.
</p>

<p>
This brings us to

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Fundimentally rooted in scientific skepticism. 
</p>

<p>
Findings may be interesting - but if they can't be reproduced by third parties in normalalized settings 
</p>

<p>
Then we're obligated to "take the word of" researchers 
</p>

<p>
rather than building on a firm foundation of findings that meet the bar of reproducibility
</p>

<p>
our modern day style of scholarly communication really begins with the introduction of the printing press into the scholarly process
</p>

<p>
The wide distribution of ideas allowed for scholars across Europe to test and refine the ideas of their peers. 
</p>

<p>
Today we face a new distribution mechanism:

<p>
Printing press is the technology that enables the goals of reproducability (as Shirky poitns out - some 150 years later)
Internet and modern computing is the technology that creates the current threat to the <code>Credability</code> of the research process
But Technology can also help to solve the problem it is creating.

<h2>Computational Science</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
While publishers and librarians come to grips with how to best utilize this new distribution mechanism (ie. Open Access)
</p>

<p>
Researchers have been struggling with how to ensure reproducibility in an environment where computation is becoming the lingua franca.

<h2>The Open Science Pipeline</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Really reproducible research spans all the steps between a data source and a publiction. 
</p>

<p>
All the steps involved in obtaining,  scrubing, modeling, interpreting and presenting data. 
</p>

<p>
This doesn't HAVE to be in the context of an open data and open access 
</p>

<p>
BUT - in this context open reproducible research brings end-to-end transparency to the entire process.

<h2></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete &#x2026; set of
instructions [and data] which generated the figures.”
David Donoho, 1998.
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
David Donoho is one of the reseachers over at Stanford who has been actively involved with the reproducibility movement for decades
</p>

<p>
As Donoho puts it:
</p>

<p>
His quote here really captures the kind of reproducibility that is creating what some are describing as a credibility crisis

<h2>A state of "Crisis"</h2>

<p>
Many of these conferences, papers, and authors have proposed tentative solutions that span a spectrum 
</p>

<p>
from technical implementations of code repositories 
</p>

<p>
to policy recommendations that seek to support socio-cultural change in the academic community.

</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/Papers.html">Victoria Stodden's work</a>
</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Of course there are many many more examples 
</p>

<p>
but what I'd like to humbly suggest,  is that at least from a technical perspective,  this is already a solved problem.
</p>

<p>
And - that there are STRONG examples in the open source software development community
</p>

<p>
for how resolve the socio-cultural aspects of the computational reproducibility problem.

<h2>Open Source Software Developers</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Reproducibility is (arguably) the number one concern of open source software developers.
</p>

<p>
As an software developer,  if the code i write and run on my system 
</p>

<p>
doesn't run on your system
</p>

<p>
my code is broken.
</p>

<p>
And they've been building tools to support reproducibility for the last 30 or 40 years.

<h3>Collaborate frequently</h3>
<p>
Usually working on teams that are <br  />
geographically disparate  <br  />
culturally diverse
</p>

</section>
<section id="sec-16-4" >

<h3>Produce complex processes that</h3>

<li>obtain 
</li>
<li>scrub

<h3>Code and Documentation</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
For software developers documentation tends to take a back seat to code 
</p>

<p>
For researchers code (and data processesing) tends to take a back seat to documentation
</p>

<p>
and by documentation i mean a publishible paper.
