<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Graduated last spring with an MSIS from here at UAlbany
</p>

<p>
Focused primarily on scholarly communication and open access
</p>

<p>
Professional background is as a software developer
</p>

<p>
Primarily working with open source tools and in the open source community
</p>
</aside>

</section>
<section id="sec-2-2" >

<h3>That's a long title</h3>
<p>
Are you really going to talk about all that in 30 minutes?
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the answer of course is no.
</p>

<p>
This talk is going to focus on reproducible research
</p>

<p>
In particular I'm going to be talking about how tools that software developers have created 
</p>

<p>
can help to solve the so-called reporducibility crisis
</p>

<h3>Caveat</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Release early, release often"<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<sup id="fn.1" style="font-size:18px;"> [1] Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997) </sup>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So there is a relatively well established philosophy in software development "Release early release often"
</p>

<p>
In software this means,  get your program out there as soon as possible and let people start giving you feedback
</p>

<p>
This presentation emerges from a relatively new interest in the topic 
</p>

<p>
Some of the ideas here are still a little rough,  but in true Open Source fashion,  I hope you'll help me refine them.

<h2>An Example from personal experience</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So - I began working as a research assistant here at Albany at the beginning of this summer
</p>

<p>
The work I'm learning to do involves writing computer programs to to pull structured information out of unstructured medical discharge summaries.  
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of interesting and practical applications for work like this
</p>

<p>
tracking patient outcomes for instance
</p>

<p>
identifying systematic issues at hospitals or with health care processes - lots of stuff.
</p>

<p>
This is done primarily with natural language process tools (ie.  computer programs and processes) 
</p>

<p>
As an initial exercize I set out to reproduce a well performing system in a particular challenge that tried to identify whether patients had obesity based on the free-form text in their medical record.

<h2>The idea was&#x2026;</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-1" >

<h3>reproduce the system based on the description in the paper,</h3>

</section>
<section id="sec-4-2" >

<h3>try to identify systematic errors</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-3" >

<h3>correct those errors</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-4" >

<h3>publish in a prestigious journal</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-4-5" >

<h3>get a tenure-track position at a respected university</h3>

<h2>So It turns out&#x2026;</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So it turns out,  this wasn't really a great plan -
</p>

<p>
The code is unavailable-  and sadly un-reproducible.
</p>

<p>
So naively - This was a complete shock to me - 
</p>

<p>
The publication was open access - which is great - but in the end the publication wasn't enough
</p>

<p>
so this presentation  is really a product of that experience and a desire to understand why it happened
</p>

<p>
and how to fix it
</p>

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Fundimentally rooted in scientific skepticism. 
</p>

<p>
Findings may be interesting - but if they can't be reproduced by other researchers in normalalized settings 
</p>

<p>
Then those findings are suspect
</p>
</aside>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="sec-7" >

<h2>Reproducibility is about Communication</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Reproducibility is about Communicatoin
</p>

<p>
its about communicating a methodology - as a skeptic I want to know  WHO did WHAT
</p>

<p>
I want to know HOW it was done WHY it was done and what were the results?
</p>

<p>
Reproducibility is about communicating with sufficient detail,  that I can verify these things for myself.
</p>
</aside>

<section id="sec-8" >

<h2>Technology enables Reproducibility</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Technology has traditionally enabled reproducibility in research by improving our ability to communicate 
</p>

<p>
Who What When How and Why with eachother.
</p>

<p>
And the first technological advance that really enabled reproducibility was:

<aside class="notes">
<p>
And on the very first page, very first sentence, Henry Oldenburg writes:
</p>

<p>
"Whereas there is nothing more necessary for promoting the improvement of Philosophical Matters, than the communicating [&#x2026; of] such things as are discovered or put in practice by others."
</p>

<p>
From the very begining scholarly communication has been about transfering findings to others in a way that can be reproduced
</p>

<p>
and importaintly built upon.

<h2>Modern Technologies make Reproducibility hard</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Fast Forward modern times - Computational science has enabled great advances in human knowledge - 
</p>

<p>
But historical mechanisms for communicating these new kinds of scientific findings have lagged.
</p>

<p>
Analysis and interpretation may still fit on 9 pages (including references)
</p>

<p>
But the data, the systems, the code - the research in its gory detail
</p>

<p>
these things linger and die on servers in campus closets.

<h2>Modern Technologies can make Reproducibility easy again</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Thankfully technology can make reproducibility easy again
</p>

<p>
Not just by rescuing code and making it available online&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But by brining the entire evolution of a publication out into the open.

<h2>The Open Science Pipeline</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
And so really, reproducible research is concerned with ALL the steps between a data source and a publiction. 
</p>

<p>
This means obtaining, scrubing, modeling, interpreting and presenting data. 
</p>

<p>
This doesn't HAVE to be in the context of open data and open access 
</p>

<p>
BUT - in this context open reproducible research brings end-to-end transparency to the entire process.

“The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete &#x2026; set of
instructions [and data] which generated the figures.”
David Donoho, 1998.

</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
David Donoho is one of the reseachers over at Stanford who has been actively involved with the reproducibility movement for decades
</p>

<p>
As Donoho puts it:
</p>

<p>
Modern methodologies are being deeply influenced by computation - but this type of reproducibility continues to be rare.

<h2>Reproducibility creates Credibility</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Reproducibility creates credibility
</p>

<p>
A finding only deserves to be published, read, cited if it can be reproduced
</p>

<p>
a lack of reproducibility introduces uncertainty. 
</p>

<p>
a sufficient lack of this kind of uncertainty and you create a crisis of confidence - 
</p>

<p>
and reciently there have been several high profile cases of irreproducible results

<h2>Open Source Software Developers</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Reproducibility is (arguably) the number one concern of open source software developers.
</p>

<p>
As a software developer,  if the code i write and run on my system 
</p>

<p>
doesn't run on your system
</p>

<p>
my code is broken.

<h2>Software Developers are Tool Oriented</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Software developers are tool oriented kind of people
</p>

<p>
They build the software tools you use every day and they use highly specialized tools to do it
</p>

<p>
if theres a problem,  
</p>

<p>
the first thing a software developer thinks is "is there a tool that solves this problem already?"
</p>

<p>
And if NOT - "can I build a tool that solves this problem?"

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
(is complicated)
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Software is complicated and historically trending TOWARDS more complexity,  not AWAY from it
</p>

<p>
But this complexity is just a problem - and so developers have done what developers know how to do
</p>

<p>
build software to solve the problem of managing software's growing complexity.

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="sec-21" >

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<p>
(is complicated)
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Data has to be obtained and investigates, 
</p>

<p>
Models have to be created and discarded, 
</p>

<p>
Hours of iteration, exploration, and dead ends go into final publications,
</p>

<p>
Keeping track of all the behind the scenes work involves a lot of complex processes
</p>
</aside>

</section>
<section>
<section id="sec-22" >

<h2>Software Tools</h2>
<p>
(can ease that complexity)
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
But - Software tools can ease complexity,  
</p>

<p>
and especially they can ease the complexity of the reproducibility problem. 
</p>

<p>
The reproducibility problem modern computational scientists face is profoundly similar to the reproducibility problems open source software developers face

<h3>Highly specialized</h3>
</section>
<section id="sec-23-2" >

<h3>Experts in their area</h3>
</section>

<h3>Collaborate frequently</h3>
<p>
Usually working on teams that are <br  />
geographically disparate  <br  />
culturally diverse
</p>

</section>
<section id="sec-23-4" >

<h3>Produce complex processes that</h3>

<h2>Tools for Reproducible Research</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The success of an open software development project is BASED on its ability to be reproduced across many systems
</p>

<p>
open source software DEVELOPERS have produced tools that are optimized to ease this distribution.
</p>

<p>
Because of the similarities between open source software developers and researchers many of these tools can be recast in light of the research process.

<h2>Git and Github</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So I want to talk about Git and Github
</p>

<p>
If we think of the reproducibility problem as both <b>technical</b> and <b>socio-cultural</b> than
</p>

<p>
Git is the response to the technical issues
</p>

<p>
and Github is the response to the social-cultural issues

<h2>Git</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So - git can be complicated -  
</p>

<p>
and my goal here is really to give a 100,000 foot view
</p>

<p>
I say this because i'm going to be glossing over some stuff in the interest of time
</p>

<p>
But if you're interested i'll be available to talk to you ad-nauseum after the presentations today

<h3>Git is a Source Control Management Systems</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So git is apart of a class of software systems called Source Control Management Systems
</p>

<p>
The Goal of any source control management system is keep a complete history of the changes that are made to a file or files

</p>

<p>
keeping track of changes in a single document is hard
</p>

<p>
keeping track of changes from a group of authors and reviewers in a single document is even harder
</p>

<p>
magnify that difficulty by the thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of documents in an software development project
</p>

<p>
and you might as well pack up and go home

<h3>Git is about Communication</h3>
<p>
<b>Who</b> did <b>what</b>, <b>when</b> and <b>why</b>?
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So Git helps you keep track of <b>Who</b> did <b>What</b> <b>When</b> and <b>Why</b> in excruciating detail
</p>

<p>
While a methodology section gives a broad overview of how an experiment was conducted
</p>

<p>
Git can provide a blow by blow, hour by hour account of how the research evolved. 
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-26-4" >

<h3>This is where Git gets complicated</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Trying to understand exactly how git does this is where things start to get jargony.
</p>

<p>
What its important to capture here is that a file (or a 100 files,  or 100,000 files) are just a recorded serise of small changes over time
</p>

<p>
Git can pass these changes around to other collaborators and make sure <b>THIER</b> copy of a document stays in sync with <b>YOUR</b> copy of that document
</p>

<p>
And in the process - it keeps a complete history of every change that everyone made.

<h3>Lets see an Example</h3>

</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So This presentation is hosted on Github and version controlled with Git
</p>

<p>
Its an HTML file and it uses a javascript library called "reveal.js"
</p>

<p>
And here it gets a little freaky,  because you guys can actually see my notes

<p>
[Show History,  Show Comment, Show Diff, Show File @ Rev]
</p>

<p>
[Use: "Cleaning up argument for technologies role in reproducibile research"]

<h2>Github</h2>
<p>
"Build better software, together"
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So what we were just looking at was actually Github - not strictly "Git"
</p>

<p>
Github is an online community that is built around and ontop of git. 
</p>

<p>
Over 4 million people use github to host and share their code with eachother.
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-27-1" >

<h3>Github is Free Hosting for Public Projects</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Githubs model is really innovative because they offer free git repository hosting 
</p>

<p>
as long as the repository is created is publicly readable
</p>

<p>
as a repository author you can descide who has direct write access,  
</p>

<p>
but ANYONE can make a copy of your work and start thier own line of development
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-27-2" >

<h3>Open Access</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Github is a world where "Open is the Default"
</p>

<p>
and I think you can make a pretty defensible argument that Github is the single largest open access publication platform that currently exists. 
</p>

<p>
In particular it provides a particularly fascinating feature that correlates nicely with research workflows.
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-27-3" >

<h3>Forking</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
"Forking" is the process of copying someone elses repository into a new line of personal development
</p>

<p>
as a mechanism,  it codifies what makes open source development so special.
</p>

<p>
Even though I might not have direct access to modify your code,  I can make a copy of it and start making changes that suit me
</p>

<p>
If my changes end up having wide applicability,  I can ask you, the original author to accept my changes BACK into the original project.
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-27-4" >

<h3>to Research is to Fork</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Researchers Fork in this way all the time. 
</p>

<p>
They read literature until they understand the intracacies of a domain,  
</p>

<p>
bring their own perspective and expertise to bear on that domain and then 
</p>

<p>
contribute back to the literature through new publications.
</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="sec-27-5" >

<h3>Hybrid Literature</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The problem is,  the 'literature',  the scientific record,   is no longer JUST papers and proceedings
</p>

<p>
Its DATA and CODE as well as text and figures. And if reseachers wish to remain credible 
</p>

<p>
They will need tools that support capturing the ENTIRE process by which they arived at their interpretations.
</p>

<p>
And venues that support publication of these kinds of histories.
</p>
</aside>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="sec-28" >

<h2>Oh yeah&#x2026; The Metrics</h2>
<p>
Lets look at <a href="https://github.com/git/git">Git</a>
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So, Because the activity of contributors is tracked with such detail,  
</p>

<p>
There is an enormous amount of raw data that is potentially available for generating metrics for researcher activity.
</p>

<p>
Instead of focusing on these sort of punctuated, episodic, papers that might provide a couple of data points about a researcher each year
</p>

<p>
We can look at the projects they've contributed too and get a much clearer picture of researcher activity.
</p>

<p>
In fact this is already happening - in certain areas of software development your github account IS your CV

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
This last weekend I re-watched "White Christmas" with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye
</p>

<p>
If you've never see it its one of these classic mid-50's musicals -
</p>

<p>
Whats shocking to me ever time i rewatch these kinds of films - 
</p>

<p>
is just how much of the movie is a filmed stage performance.
</p>

<p>
You can really see these sorts of moviews as a shift from one medium to the next
</p>

<p>
from stage to film
