** Who Am I?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Graduated last spring with an MSIS from here at UAlbany

Focused primarily on scholarly communication and open access

Last 10 years -amature/professional software developer

both in private sector doing web application development

and in academia as a research assistant.

** That's a long title
Are you really going to talk about all that in 30 minutes?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
So the answer of course is no.

This talk is going to focus on reproducible research

cast it in the light of some problems that software engineers have been facing for a number of years

* An Example from personal experience
(subtitle: an origin story)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
So - I began working as a research assistant here at Albany at the beginning of this summer

The work I'm learning to do involves writing computer programs to to pull structured information out of unstructured medical discharge summaries.  

There are a lot of interesting and practical applications for work like this

tracking patient outcomes for instance

identifying systematic issues at hospitals or with health care processes - lots of stuff.

This is done primarily with natural language process tools (ie.  computer programs and processes) 

As an initial exercize I set out to reproduce a well performing system in a particular challenge that tried to identify whether patients had obesity based on the free-form text in their medical record.

#+END_NOTES
** The idea was...
*** reproduce the system based on the description in the paper,

*** try to identify any systematic errors the system made

*** correct those errors

*** publish in a prestigious journal

*** get a tenure-track position at a respected university

*** live happily ever afer.


** So It turns out...
#+BEGIN_NOTES
So it turns out this wasn't a very good plan - 

I spent about a month trying to reproduce the system from the paper - too many variables, too much complexity

Finally in desperation I emailed the original authors, while they were extreamly helpful - the original system couldn't be found. 

They had moved to a different institution

It was simply no longer accessable.

* Reproducibility

** TODO Notes about early goals of reproducability
Printing press is the technology that enables the goals of reproducability (as Shirky poitns out - some 150 years later)
Internet and modern computing is the technology that creates the current threat to the =Credability= of the research process
But Technology can also help to solve the problem it is creating.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete ... set of
instructions [and data] which generated the figures.”
David Donoho, 1998.

** Open Access
*** Copyright exists to incentiveze creative works of non-trival effort
*** For scholars, incentive structure for publication is different
*** Attribution still a key factor
*** Prestige infrastructure 

** Science Code Manifesto

*** Code
#+BEING_NOTES
All source code written specifically to process data for a published paper must be available to the reviewers and readers of the paper.
#+END_NOTES
*** Copyright
#+BEING_NOTES
The copyright ownership and license of any released source code must be clearly stated.
#+END_NOTES
*** Citation
#+BEING_NOTES
Researchers who use or adapt science source code in their research must credit the code’s creators in resulting publications.
#+END_NOTES
*** Credit
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Software contributions must be included in systems of scientific assessment, credit, and recognition.
#+END_NOTES
*** Curation
#+BEGIN_NOTES

Source code must remain available, linked to related materials, for the useful lifetime of the publication.
