** Who Am I?
Well I'm chris kotfila!
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Graduated last spring with an MSIS from here at UAlbany

Focused primarily on scholarly communication and open access

Last 10 years - professional software developer

both in private sector doing web application development

and in academia as a research assistant.

** Thanks to Victoria Stoden
Some of the Introductory material here pulls from Victoria Stoden's Presentation at the Open Knowledge Foundation's 2013 Conference
** Objectives
#+BEGIN_NOTES
I'm hoping to use this presentation to convince you that software engineers and researchers have similar problems

#+END_NOTES
** That's a long title
Are you really going to talk about all that in 30 minutes?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
So the answer of course is no.

This talk is going to focus on reproducible research

cast it in the light of some software engineering problems that have been

** TODO Notes about early goals of reproducability
Printing press is the technology that enables the goals of reproducability (as Shirky poitns out - some 150 years later)
Internet and modern computing is the technology that creates the current threat to the =Credability= of the research process
But Technology can also help to solve the problem it is creating.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete ... set of
instructions [and data] which generated the figures.”
David Donoho, 1998.

* Examples


#+BEGIN_SRC R :results graphics :file img/graph.png :exports results
# Define 2 vectors
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
trucks <- c(2, 5, 4, 5, 12)

# Graph cars using a y axis that ranges from 0 to 12
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue", ylim=c(0,12))

# Graph trucks with red dashed line and square points
lines(trucks, type="o", pch=22, lty=2, col="red")

# Create a title with a red, bold/italic font
title(main="Autos", col.main="red", font.main=4)
